# Smart-city
A smart city prototype with 8 automated modules 
## MODULES INCLUDED
1. Human activity recognition
2. Smart Weather station and predictor
3. Smart parking system 
4. Smart lighting system
5. Smart Irrigation system
6. Smart Garbage System
7. Smart Traffic light 
8. Smart Water Quality System

# Features:
### Water Quality System
 1. PH , turbidity , temperature measures of the water 
 2. GPS module for location details
 3. Live tracking with thinkspeak server

### Street Light automation
1. Automated street light for conservation of
energy by reducing electricity wastage as well as to reduce the manpower.
2. Movement sensitive street lighting system will be implemented, in which,
with the help of IR sensors; we are detecting any movement on the road and the micro-
controller glows the light only the places where lighting is required and other lights will
remain in an OFF state.

### Smart Traffic control 
1. A self-monitoring vehicle density-based traffic light system on the four-
lane on 4-lane intersection has been implemented.
2. The module will detect the maximum density which will signify the congestion and then
provide methods to control this congestion and ensure that a smooth flow of traffic is
there and no casualties are there due to traffic-related issues faced in the day-to-day lives.

### Weather Station and predictor
1. It can provide us with details about the surrounding temperature, barometric pressure, humidity.
2. Location and live data monitoring with thinkspeak server.
### Parking system 
1. It consists of two parts where first part is the parking area which include
Arduino devices along with IR Sensor.
2. Number plate recognition using OPENCV and tesseract library.
3. Automated parking slot allotment with management of all parking slots available.

### Smart Irrigation system
1. The proposed system has been designed to overcome the unnecessary water flow into the
agricultural lands. Temperature, moisture and humidity readings are continuously monitored
by using temperature, moisture and humidity sensor and send these values to the assigned IP
address.

2. Cloud based service continuously collects the data from that assigned IP address. Once
the soil moisture values are exceeded the particular limit then the relay, which is connected to
the Arduino microcontroller controls the motor.

### Garbage management system
1. Smart dustbin is a new idea of implementation
which makes a normal dustbin smart using Ultrasonic Sensors for garbage level detection.
2. Gps module for location of garbage bin and alert to garbage collectors to facilitiate easy management.

### Human activity recognition for Surveillance
1. 3D CNN MODEL with keras to recognize human activity.
2. Numpy for creating array out of extracted frames.
